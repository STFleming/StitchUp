Control-flow errors can be catastrophic, causing real-time deadlines to be missed, or worse non-termination.
This work presents StitchUp a compiler flag for the Open Source HLS tool LegUp, which can automatically extract and protect the control-flow of an input program.
To demonstrate this we applied it to the popular HLS benchmark suite CHStone and performed exhaustive hardware error injection on a selection of circuits.
Our results show that StitchUp is capable of detecting all execution time errors while requiring a smaller fraction of the resources and power than DMR.
