\subsection{Introduction}
To test the full system exhaustive fault injection of the configuration bits was performed.

\subsection{Fault Injection Rig}
Multiple Zynq systems. Essential bits generation of Partially reconfigurable regions.
Error Injection with the SEM core. Reconfiguration every injection vs Reconfiguration just
on stuck bits. Experiment run times.

\subsection{Experiment run}
Error categories and classification.
Detection methods.
