CHAOS MONKEY:

These passes are intended to cause problems in the bitstream.
The user of the chaos monkey should have the ability to control
exactly where the errors end up, with the ability to select 
between data path errors (ignored by the CFG shadow) and
control flow errors (detectable by the CFG).
