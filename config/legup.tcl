# BEGIN PATTERN SHARING PARAMETERS
################################################################################

# Pattern sharing is an optimization which reduces circuit area by sharing 
# functional units and registers. Specifically it improves the logic density of 
# the design by combining many, under-utilized LUTs (e.g. 3-4 LUTs) into fewer, 
# larger LUTs (5-6 LUTs) and in the process reducing the total number of 
# registers.
#
# While pattern sharing reduces circuit area, experiments have shown that it
# can impact fmax positively but also (more commonly) negatively. While some 
# of this may be attributed to seed noise, the algorithm combines functional 
# units by adding logic (multiplexers) to the design so depending on the 
# circuit the critical path can become longer. On the other hand, improving 
# logic density and reducing the circuit size allows the design to be packed 
# more closely and this can reduce routing delays.
